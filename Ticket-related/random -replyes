Hello,

Thank you for getting back to us!

Please find the answers to your questions below

1. I don’t find how i add create pop-up for before close browser for provide to customer last campaing or benefits (like discount, coupon etc)
=> Un fornatull it is not possible with the CartFlows, you need to install another plugin to achive this functionality. I have found this plugin you can try this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/exit-popup/

2. I don’t find how i make data collect from user with pop-up or something like that.
=> You can add the popup using your page builder, and to collect the data you can place the from on it. 

3. I guess your analytics feautre is not ready for pro version too. Right?
=> What exactly you want to do? We are working on the analytics to improve the tracking and adding some features.

4. Can i make integration to another app? Mailchimp, some crm etc?
=> Actually, you have to make the integration with the WooCommerce & the Mailchimp or any other CRM, if they are compatible with the WooCommerce then it will automatically work with the CartFlows.

5. I think A/B test is very important to this app
=> Yes, we have this feature in our plan and it will be planned accordingly. 

I hope this clarify you.

Please let me know in case you have more questions.

Hello,

Please find the answers to your questions below.

1. I don’t need clickfunnels and also don’t need thrivecart if i have cartflows Is that right?
=> I don't say yes either, but those are for different platforms and different environments. But I can say that CartFlows can do a lot as well. using the CartFlows you can replace the default old looking checkout page and provide the bump order & the upsell & downsell as well. Also we have our custom field editor too. 

2. What i also like with thrivecart is the integration with shopify. Can i do the same with cartflows? So the product what i sell within my funnel push this to my shopify adminstration?
=> Unfornatully, There is no possible integration with the cartFlows & Shoppify but you can integrate shopify with the WooCommerce and which will automatically shwould work with the CartFlows. Because the CartFlows uses the WooCommerce as a base plugin.
Here is the article of WooCommerce & Shopify integration: https://automate.io/integration/shopify/woocommerce

Please let me know how it goes.


====================================================================================================================================================== 

1. Coupons auto applied by other plugins don’t work in checkout page
=> From which plugin you want to add the coupons? As of now, if the coupon is already applied then the other coupon will not be applied. Also, if you are trying to apply the coupon from the URL then it will not work as because we haven't added the support for it on the checkout page. 

2. Does product variation has input fields?
=> No, Product variation don't have the input fields. Here is how it works: You need to select the product in the backend setting of the checkout page which is having the variation. Then you need to enable the Products, variation & Options setting, select the bellow options mentions, enable the variation & quantity options. This settings will display the Product variation on the CartFlows checkout page. 
Check below images for the reference: 
1. https://cl.ly/bf3eb796adb9
2. https://cl.ly/bf3eb796adb9

3. After the update form has become half
=> In the recent update we have released a new feature to include the theme's header & footer on the CartFlows pages. Can you please tell me what is the value of the Post Atributes on the checkout page? Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/984cdfbe22e9
Can you please provide the URL of the page where I can check this? 

I hope this clarifies you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Welcome to the CartFlows Support!

Please find the answers to your questions below!

1. What happens in a flow if a customer pays with paypal (i do not have reference transactions enabled) in an upsell step?
=> The paypal has two payment gateways and that are PayPal Standard & PayPal Express Checkout. So in the PayPal standard, when the user is going to purchase the main product from the checkout page he will be redirected to PayPals page to login & make the payment or pay using the Credit/Debit Card. When the amount/transaction is been captured by the Paypal he will be redirected back to your website and here CartFlows will check for the next step is present or not like upsell or downsell. If the Upsell/Downsell is present then he will be redirected to the upsell/downsell page and if the user accepts the upsell then an another charge will be automatically been captured by the PayPal adding the Upsell or downsell in the order. Once the order is been registered in the PayPal the user will be redirected to the Thank you page and the checkout process gets complete. 

The same process will happen with the PayPal express checkout  payment gateway. Only the difference is that, instead of redirecting the user on the PayPal's website to make the payment. The PayPal will open a new popup/window shoing the options to make the payment. This is the same for the upsell & Downsell. Thus this popup is displayed at the time of Upsell & Downsell to make the One click upsell/downsell happen you need to enable the reference transaction in the CartFlows settings page as well as on the PayPal account too. 

2. Also, if a customer paid with stripe, but didnt got the upsell, can I send him back later (ie. 2 days later) to the upsell step? will they be able to pay with one click?
=> If the user didnt got the upsell using the stripe then you cannot send the direct URL of the Upsell / Downsell page because, CartFlows adds the upsell / Downsell product in the same order that is been created at the time of purchasing the main product from the checkout page. Thus, if you send the direct Upsell / Downsell page URL to your then will get the error as "Order does not found/exist" OR "You cannot access this page directly". 

Instead yoou can add that Upsell product on the seperate checkout page and send him the URL of that page to purchase it separeately. 

3. Are Upsells like a "yes" condition, and downsells like a "no" condition? So a if a flow is like: Landing -> checkout -> upsell -> downsell -> upsell -> downsell, etc. So if the customer accepted the first upsell, he will be redirected to ne next upsell (skipping the downsell), right?
=>Yes, If the user accepts the first Upsell then he will be redirected to the next upsell and then to thank you page to complete the checkout process.

I hope this clarify you.

Feel free to get in touch in case you have more questions.

Hello,

Welcome to the CartFlows support!

Please find the answers to your question below.

1. First problem is on my large computer i can't go to the payment section.. i can easily type in all my delivery information but i'm not given acces to go to the "second step" which is the payment. - But it works perfectly on my laptop and phone.
=> That's odd, I just checked your page and didn't found any errors or warnings on the browser's console too. As because, that functionality is been handled from the JS code. Also, I found that you are using an autoptimize plugin for the caching. Can you please try clearing & excluding the CartFlows checkout pages for the cache as because it can mixup the JS and some times functionality does not works. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/89b7c753cc9e

Let me know in case you need more clarification.

2. My second problem is adding several checkouts. I'm selling subscription based products and i have 3 different subscriptions. and i would like each one to show the different product the costumer is about to purchase.But when i try adding several checkouts it always just shows my "global checkout"... i even tried not having a global checkout, but then it just shows the regular WooCommerce checkout.(and i have added the different products to the checkouts).
=> actually if you set the CartFlows checkout page as a global checkout then your checkout process will be Shop -> Cart -> Checkout -> Upsell / downsell -> Thank you. 

But If you are adding the multiple checkout pages in the single flow then only one checkout page will work. Also, if you have set the global checkout and still you want to use the separate checkout pages then they can be accssed from the landing page only using the next step link.

I hope this clarify you.

Feel free to get in touch in case you need more help I am here to help you out. 

Please expect the delay in the response due to the weekend.

" Oh I see your discussion. It was related to string translation vs entire page translations and how page translations create a clone of your page, thus causing this. Copying an entire step in a flow for the translation is not something that works. But you can translate the strings. "

1. Just to verify - is it possible or not? I am more an more confused. Since I love the plugin I want to double check on this again. 
=> Currently, we haven't added a full support of the WPML in the CartFlows where you can translate the full pages. Here is what WPML does while tanslating the page: WPML create  duplicate post for the page that you wanted to translate & copies all its metadata along with it. 
But, as we have not added the compatibility WPML dies creates a duplicate post and does copies all the metadata but unable to communicate back with the CartFlows saying this is the new post which is translated instead of the original. And here it creates the problem. The post gives not found error or something else. But instead of translating the wholse page you can translate the strings present on that page using WPML as well as the Loco translate plugin.

2. I tried WPML String translation but that doesn't seem to work. Or am I missing something?
=> Have you gone through the steps which are mentioned below? If not then can you please give it a try. This will translate the strings on the page. 
 1) Go to WPML->Themes & Plugin localization and check the "Translate the theme and plugins using WPML's String Translation" checkbox
 2) Once saved go below the page under "Strings in the theme/plugins"
 3) Choose the woocommerce plugin that you are using and select the "Scan the themes/plugins for strings" Button
 4) Once the scanning process is finished, go to WPML->Strings translation - Search for the strings and translate them to the secondary languages.
 
3. If it's possible with Loco translate I could try to do it. But will that be possible if I still use WPML for the rest?
=> We haven't tried translating the plugin by keeping both plugins active but you can try and let me know in case you face any issues.

Please follow the below steps to translate the Coupon text and the button text. 
1. Install & activate the Loco Translate Plugin. You can download it from here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/
2. Goto Loco Translate ( Menu- left-hand side )-> Plugins -> Select CartFlows -> Click on New language -> Select the language you want to translate into.  
3. Search the words/string you want to translate and save the changes after adding translated text
4. Goto Setting -> General -> Site language. Change the site language to which you want to translate all the text and save the changes. 

See this video to get step by step instruction/view on how to translate the strings: https://bit.ly/2CH2nlp ( This is just for the example purpose )

Let me know how it goes. 

4. If there's any way to do this, please let me know a little more detailed how it's possible. 
=> Also, you can translate the pages using the already translated files. We have set up the GlotPress project where users contributes to translating the plugin strings. 

You can download the already translated files of your language from our Glotpress account from here: https://translate.cartflows.com/glotpress/projects/
Steps to include the files are:
1. Visit the above-provided link and select the plugin name Free Or Pro.
2. Search for your language and click on it. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and export the files. You need .mo & .po files to translate the strings in the plugin. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/c87522258a3f

I hope this helps.

Please let me know in case you need more help. I am here to help you out. 

Please expect the delay due to the weekend.

====================================================================================================================================================== 


Hello,

Thank you for getting back to us & sorry for the delay in the response due to the weekend. 

I checked the checkout page URL and it seems that the settings that you have applied are working fine. Because the create an account field are not visible on the checkout page. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/b136e41c12af

If you are still facing the same problem then can you please try clearing the cache of your site? 

Also If you are saying that the user is getting this form as mentioned in the screenshot then this form is coming from the firewall setting that you have applied on your site. Try disabling the firewall and let me know how it gos. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/49f35e7a754d

You can create a user by using this email id: support@cartflows.com and share the username & password. 

2. The checkout fields in the mobile version are too short.
=> We have already an update regarding this issue, can you please update the free version of the CartFlows. If you have updated the plugin then i checked the CSS file and it looks like that you are using a caching & the CSS optimization plugins. Can you please try clearing the cache and let me know how it goes. 

3. Two icons not showing up when I check from my mobile device.
=> I checked and found that the Icons which you have mentioned in the screenshot is displaying properly in the mobile devices. If you are not able to view then can you please check the mobile device settings made from your page builder. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/03d9033e4a3e

Also, there are some console errors in the browser due to which it also can happen. The main reason behind the console errors is the cache or minification of the JS & CSS files. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/84fb31f6e57c

So, can you please try deactivating these plugins & let me know how it goes. 

Feel free to get in touch in case you need more help.

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us!

Please find the answers to your questions below.

- Does the checkout work just like a normal Woo Checkout? We are using AutomateWoo for cart abandonment and would like to know if it will work the same with CartFlows checkout.
=> Yes, it should work with the AutomateWoo as it is working with the Default Checkout page. The CartFlows is using the same checkout fields as the WooCommerce's fields. So, if you want to integrate anything with the CartFlows then you need to integrate it with the WooCommerce. 


- As we are operating in some countries that do not support Stripe would we be able to speed up upsell/downsell support for Klarna & Checkout.com payment gateways if we co-finance the development?
=> I have notified about this to our management and everything goes well, we will start working on it and let you know.


- Is it possible to add different upsells based on the payment gateway selection? Lets say a client selects PayPal as a payment method and we would like to show flow A, but when they select Stripe as payment method, we would like to show flow B.
=> Unfornatully it is not possible to display the upsell / downsell on the basis of the payment gateway. But it is a nice suggestion and a idea, I have added this into our list and it will be planned accordingly.


- Is it possible to add different shipping costs based on the payment gateway selection? If someone would select PayPal, we would charge 5$, but if someone would select Stripe, we would charge 4$.
=> Unfornatully this is related to the WooCommerce and you need to find the separate plugin to make it happen. I searched for it and found an article of the WooCommerce. I hope this will help you. Here is the link of it: https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-conditional-shipping-and-payments/


- When selling subscription products with CartFlows, can we sell 1$ trial version of a product and then offer a yearly subscription of the same product on upsell?
=> Actually, you can offer the subscription product in the upsell/downsell but if you want to sell the $1 trial version product and the same product in the upsell for a yearly subscription then the subscription of the first product offered on the checkout page having the $1 price will not be cancled and the again another same product will be purchased on the upsell. In this case you have to cancel the subscription of the $1 product manually. 

- What is your plan for the upcomming 3D Secure 2 enforcement in Europe, that is comming in September. We have checked the current checkout flow with a 3d Secure 2 test card on Stripe, and it works, but it ignores the upsell/downsell steps: http://recordit.co/RHi65Z0By2
=> The 3D Secure 2 will work with the normal checkout process and the bump order but it will skip the upsell/downsell because it is not integrated with the upsell/downsell. We have it in our list to integrate it with the CartFlows along with all other payment gateways. If we get more request for it then will be prioritize it. 


I hope this clarify you.

Let me know in case you have more questions. 


====================================================================================================================================================== 


Hello,

Thank you for your patience!

I have an update regarding your questions.

Please find the answers to your questions below

1. Is there any way that I can set the CartFlow Steps (Pages) as the default fall-back "Checkout" or "Cart" Page for WooCommerce??
=> Actually it is not possible, that means you cannot directly select the checkout page in the WooCommerce's page settings. Instead you can set the checkout page as a global checkout. This will automatically redirect you to the CartFlows checkout page instead of default checkout page. 

2. the product is added to cart, but the "View Cart" popup banner still appears at the top of the page...
=> It is the default WooCommerce functionality however you can disable this message from apearing on the page that you have created by using the custom code. Here the code for it. add_filter( 'wc_add_to_cart_message_html', '__return_null' ); Add this custom code into your child theme's functions.php file at the very end of it. 

3. If the customer (or you) clicks "View Cart" then this takes them to https://brioaudio.com/cart__trashed/ which is a error page. (I have removed the default cart page since it was very ugly with the Elementor Hello Theme. 
=> This page is required to display the cart page and for the some functionality such as to add the products in the cart. If you delete this page, then there is a chanse that some of the cart which is dependant on it might not work. However you can design the Cart page as per our needs using the page builder. Here are some articles which can help you to do it. 
	I. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuLyJbH9TTo
	II. https://wordpress.org/plugins/personalize-woocommerce-cart-page/

4. I would like this (or any time the brioaudio.com/cart) to redirect to the CartFlows page. But I can't figure out how to do it because the cartflows page doesn't show up as an actual page.
=> If you want to redirect the the Cart page to the CartFlows Checkout page then you need to add the redirection rule for it. Otherwise there is a custom code, which will redirect the user to the checkout page when the user clicks on the "View Cart" button. 
Here is the custom code for this: Please add this into your child theme's functions.php file at the very end of it. 

add_filter('woocommerce_add_to_cart_redirect', 'in_redirect_add_to_cart');
function in_redirect_add_to_cart() {
    $cw_redirect_url_checkout = "checkout-page-8"; // Here add the slug of the page on which you want to redirect. ( Slug = https://cl.ly/a161d6a99e09 )
    return $cw_redirect_url_checkout;
}

Also, the steps that you mentioned in the expected section, is currently working at our end. 
Check this video of it: https://cl.ly/5f41f0d2ff23	

Can you please confirm it is working at your end too? If not then please let me know. I will try my best to make this happen. 

I hope this clarify you!

Please feel free to get in touch in case you need more help I am here to help you out.

Hello Faith,

Thank you for getting back to us!


Please find the answers to your questions below.

1. Is there a way to design the checkout page, so that user can reduce or cancel ordered items? At the moment my Woocommerce will not allow it. Do you think override this with cart flows? or generally the base woocommerce settings rule?
=> Yes, you can customize the CartFlows Checkout page but if you want to customize the WooCommerce's Default Checkout page using the CartFlows then it is not possible. Because the CartFlows is not a page builder it is a Sales funnel Builder.
So, if you want to change the UI of the Default Checkout page then you can set the CartFlows Checkout page as a Global Checkout. This will replace the Default page with the CartFlows checkout page. Also it will inherit the WooCommerce's default page properties too. 


2. I see this on the edit page. What does that mean? http://prntscr.com/o9z4y7
=> This message is displaying because the page builder displays the shortcode in the Iframe while editing the page. So, some functions of the WooCommerce are not present that is why this message is displayed. To make it work you can make the changes in the page and update the changes it will start to display the fields. Also, you can press right button click of the mouse while the control ( ctrl ) button pressed and select the option reload the iframe. 


3.  I activated Beaver Builder but I still see the same templates. Actually I see only 4 free templates (even what was free is now also pro)
Is this normal?
=> Actually, when you acivates the beaver builder then you will get four free flow templates & the 4 Pro Flow templates. 
Also here are the numbers of templates that you will get. 

Free Version
- landing page 	 = 4
- Checkout page  = 4
- Upsell Page    = 0
- Downsell Page  = 0
- Thank You page = 4

Pro Version  ( Free Version templates will also be added )
- landing page 	 = 4
- Checkout page  = 4
- Upsell Page    = 4
- Downsell Page  = 4
- Thank You page = 4


4 I am trying to set up Cartflows for my other website, but I have the same issues as before. Please check https://mayaburcum.com/checkout-page/
Which code I should add now, and where?
=> Unfornatully I an not able to see the theme conflict on the page. Can you please provide the screenshot of it or the login details of the site will do the needful.

I hope this clarify you.

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

====================================================================================================================================================== 

Hello,

Welcome to the CartFlows!

Please find the answers to your questions below.

1. Are the templates being updated?
=> Yes, we update the templates whenever and whatever it is necessary. Also, it do updates if some changes are suggested internaly.

2. Are the templates proven to be an effective funnel? Or should I actually build from scratch? If so, is there any tutorial on how to build an effective funnel with cartflows?
=> Currently, we are using one of our template of the CartFlows on the our website too. So far, it is performing good. But, you can also import the ready-made template & modify them using the page builder to save your time instead of starting it from the scratch. 
We have a youtube channel where we post the video for education purpose. Here is the link of it: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEdXT5pEI_Vbd5te5v7sOpQ

Also, we have a documentation section, here is a link of our docs: https://cartflows.com/docs/


3. I noticed that direct transfer is not supported for upsell/downsell, would it be implemented in the future? Or is it not suggested to use direct transfer for a funnel?
=> Currently, it is not supported but we have it in a plan to integrate it to add the support for the Upsell & Downsell. Currently we have taken the authorize.net on priority for the integration. If we get more user requests for the direct transfer then we will surely prioritize it.


4. Should I rename the URL to the product's name? Like ".com/towel-landing-page", ".com/towel-upsell", etc. Do you have a better suggestion?
=> Yes, you need change the URL of the page. to give the name of your choise to your page then you can change the permalink for that page. Check this image for the reference: https://cl.ly/efd0c629716b

5. Do we have a tutorial hub for Cartflows for more in-depth guides?
=> We have a youtube channel where we post the video for education purpose. Here is the link of it: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEdXT5pEI_Vbd5te5v7sOpQ

Also, we have a documentation section, here is a link of our docs: https://cartflows.com/docs/

6. If I have multiple products for sale, is it better to have one funnel for each of them and send traffics to them instead of the standard woocommerce shop page?
=> Instead of creating a multiple funnels for each and every single product is time consuming, but to reduce this time you can set the CartFlows checkout page as a Global Checkout. This option will replace your default WooCommerce's checkout page with the CartFlows Checkout. Which will change your checkout process as follows:

	1. Shop Page -> Where all the products will be listed.
	2. Cart Page -> Here the products will be displayed which are added by the user.
	3. Checkout page -> This page will be of CartFlows, b'caz, it is been set as a Global Checkout. User will proceed for the order from this page.
	4. Upsell/Downsell -> If these offers pages are availabe then the user will be redirected to these pages after the checkout is complete.
	5. Thank you page -> Here all the order Summary will be displayed. 

======================================================================================================================================================

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us!

Please find the answers to your questions below.

#1. For the first Page of the checkout, is it possible to only collect First Name, Last Name, Phone # ?
=> Yes, you can collect only the First Name, Last Name & the Phone number, but if you are giving the user to make the payment using the PayPal gateway then the PayPal needs the email id to initiate the transaction. 

You can disable the fields from the Checkout page setting available in the backend from the custom fields tabs. Enable the Custom field editor and disable the fields that you don't want by clicking on the eye icon. This will remove the fields from the checkout page. 

2. Is there a progress bar available and shown during the check out process?
=> I am sorry, but currently it is not available, but still, if you need it then you can add it by using another plugin and if your page builder does have this feature then you can add it. 

#3. On the Address + Credit Card Info Page, is it also possible to add a “checkbox” so that a customer can manually check for recurring billing because we are selling a recurring billing @ $299 per month for our membership site?
=> I am sorry, but currently, it is not available, but there is another way. You can create the two products the first product is having the full payment & the second is having the recurring payment. If the user adds the recurring product then he will be charged in a recurring manner. 

#4. How would we integrate the form data captured by Cart Flows with our online merchant?
=> I am not sure that I understand your question fully, but it seems that you need to send the users info to your CRM for further process or sending an email then you need a separate plugin which will capture the data from the checkout page and send it to your CRM. You need to integrate that plugin with the WooCommerce. Because the CartFlows works on the WooCommerce base and uses the same checkout fields of the WooCommerce.

I hope this will clarify you.

Please feel free to get in touch in case you have more questions.

1. Customer access the site and request for a quote for a professional service.
=> Users can still access and open a request for the quote from the services section and the serveice can be add to cart.
2. Store owner will create a new order through woocommerce.
3. Send new order notification email to customer through woocommerce.

4. Add new order to a specific customer cart. 

5. Customer click on the link to pay from email and direct customer to cart/checkout page. Customer also can login to the site and will see the order in the cart.
6. Customer have the option to add coupon code to get discount. (Coupon code is linked to affiliate )
7. Customer can proceed to checkout page and make the payment.
8. Update woocommerce order with the order status.
9. tracking and monitoring the abounded orders 


So, to get the quote for a professional service then you need to use the another plugin which will work with the WooCommerce and can generate the quotes.

Users can still access and open a request for the quote from the services section and the serveice can be add to cart. After cart the user will be redirected to the checkout page where store manager has already added the required product on checkout page from the backend setting. 

After the user visited the checkout page, he will add his billing details and procees for the payment and the new order will be automatically created and the order summary & the order will be mailed to both the store manager & the user who just purchased the service.


Also, you can create as many flows you want in the CartFlows. For example, there total 5 services and you can create the 5 flows/checkout pages for each of the services and redirect the user to their respective checkout page. Otherwise you can set the CartFlows Checkout page as a global checkout, so that all your services will be listed on the shop page of the WooCommerce and user will pick whichever he wants then proceed to the Cart page after that to the Checkout page of the CartFlows after that if the upsell & downsell is present will be displayed else will be redirected to the thank you page for for displaying the order summary. 

Also, we have released a new plugin called as WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery. You can download it from here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-cart-abandonment-recovery/

This will automatically grab the abandonmened user's data and will display it them into the dashboard so that you can schedue the emails to recover them back. 

I hope this clarifies you. 

Please let me know in case you need more clarification.

I will certainly mark a 5 star rating. Thank you so much for your help. 

I uploaded WP Super Cache plugin and followed the instructions to omit the cart page and thank you page URL from being cached. It did not work. 

The elementor editor wasn't showing the cart page information even with the shortcode in place. So I deactivated the WP Super Cache and uploaded the Breeze plugin.  

I followed the same instructions to delete the cart page and thank you page URL.  

Still, the elementor editor and the live update on the website wasn't showing cart page information.  I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

Could you please walk me through what you did to make the cart page fields visible on the elementor editing page and on the live website page. 

It is important for me to understand what I am doing wrong so that, in the future, I am able to correct this on my own.  

I very much appreciate your time, advice and service. Thanks again for your assistance.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Have a good one! 🙂🙂

1. Yes, we would like your help to customize the CSS Code for the heading on the checkout.
=> Here is the custom code to change the string of on the checkout page. Please add the below code into your child theme's functions.php file at the very end of it.

// Function with the main logic.
function wc_billing_field_strings( $translated_text, $text, $domain ) {
    switch ( $translated_text ) {
        case 'Billing details' :
            $translated_text = __( 'Informations', 'woocommerce' ); // You can add your text here. Just replace the "Informations" text with your text
            break;

        case 'Your order' :
            $translated_text = __( 'Votre commande', 'woocommerce' ); // You can add your text here. Just replace the "Votre commande" text with your text
            break;
    }
    // Return the all the strings.
    return $translated_text;
}
// Triguer the action
add_filter( 'gettext', 'wc_billing_field_strings', 20, 3 );



2. For the button code, we do not have that specific option on the buddyboss theme. The golden color applies for a lot of features, so we cannot change it.
=> Yes it is possible to overwrite with the custom CSS code. Below is the custom CSS code for it. Please add it into your theme's customizer -> Under additional CSS tab. 

.cartflows_step-template .woocommerce-checkout #payment #place_order{
	background-color: #00bb80;
}



3. We have enabled APPLE PAY in the stripe/woocommerce options, but it seems to not appear on the checkout form. Is it normal ?
=> I am not sure that, have you verified the domain to enable the Apple pay on the checkout page from the Stripe's dashboard? Also, is it displaying on the default checkout page? 

Here is an article which can help you to enable & verify the setting for the apple pay: https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/accepting-apple-pay-woocommerce/

I hope this helps you .

Please let me know how it goes.

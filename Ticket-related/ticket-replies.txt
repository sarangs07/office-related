Header & footer using Elementor
https://bit.ly/2UrxJa2 

========================================================================================================================================================

No Header & footer

Hello,
﻿
Thank you for contacting us!
﻿
Unfortunately, it is not possible to add the theme's header & footer on the CartFlows' page.
﻿
But we have a sit in a plan to give an option for the user to enable/disable the header/footer on the CartFlows pages. We will be introducing a new template type, through which users can add the theme's header & footer on the CartFlows pages.
﻿
The reason behind of not loading the header/footer on the CartFlows pages is to avoid the UI conflicts with the design.
﻿
If you are using Elementor Pro then you can create a custom menu on the CartFlows Page ( Ref: https://bit.ly/2EAUsGv ). In this case, you have to design accordingly to your needs.
﻿
Let me know your thoughts on this.
﻿

Invalid License ID


Usually, this error comes when WordPress fails to generate the instance key while validating the license. This issue is temporary and can be solved by just deactivate the plugin & re-activate it.

﻿Also, if you are using any cache plugin then can you please try clearing the cache and disable the cache plugin too. Sometimes this blocks to update the instance ID.

Let me know your thoughts on this. 

========================================================================================================================================================

Can't Activate the License

﻿Hello,

I am sorry that you are not able to activate the license of your copy. Don't worry, I will help you with this.

Can you please tell me, are you using any cache plugins? If yes, then this is might be due to cache & can be easily solved!

Usually, the instance required to activate the license gets cached along with the JS and the Ajax requests which are required to validate the License. Thus the response received after validation call does not stored properly and this issue occours.

So can you please try the below steps 
1. Clear the cache﻿﻿ & deactivating that Cache plugin.
2. Deactivate the CartFlows Pro plugin & re-activate the CartFlows Pro.
3. Enter the License to activate it.

If you still face the same issue then please provide the wp-admin login details so that I can take a look.

Cannot Refund!

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us!

I am sorry to say but the time period to refund is over and it is no longer eligible for reimbursement. Because your first purchase was originally made on 8th July 2019.

We do offer a 30 day guarantee period which begins on your first purchase date as outlined in our refund policy page, thus this transaction is no longer eligible for reimbursement.

See our return policy as outlined here https://cartflows.com/refund-policy/
Please feel free to get in touch in case you have any questions.


========================================================================================================================================================

Welcome to the CartFlows Support!

I'm so sorry to see our product did not meet your expectations and see you go. Would you like to share your thoughts/feedback which causes you to apply for the refund? So that we can improve the plugin and make it more flexible & user-friendly.

Meanwhile, I will assign your ticket to our store manager so that he can review & initiate your refund process.

Common reply for the payment gateway

We have it in a plan to integrate more payment gateway in the CartFlows to add the support for the Upsell & Downsell. We have other things lined up with the priority as per the new functionality addition and the fixes which users are facing but our plan is to start integrating the payment gateway somewhere in June but it might be more or less.

Till then, you can start integrating the Stripe on your site and offer the upsell.

I hope this clarify you.

Feel free to get in touch in case you have more questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------
I have added this payment gateway integration into our suggestion list. If we get more request from the users then we will prioritize it.
------------------------------------------------------------------

This will automatically work for the default checkout process on the CartFlows checkout page including the Bump order, pre-checkout offer. But if you want to offer the Upsell & downsell to the user then it will not work because we haven't added the custom support for this payment gateway in the CartFlows.
﻿
﻿We have it in our payment gateway list and it will be added in the future once we have finished the required features. If we get the more request for this then we will priotize it.
﻿

========================================================================================================================================================

Hello,

Welcome to the CartFlows Support!

We have fixed this issue and released an update of it. Can you please try updating the CartFlows Free version?

Cart Abandonment Sale/Descriptio/working message

Hello,

If you want to add the popup to capture the email address of the user to send the email if he abandons the cart with the help of your page builder and you can add the form on it. Also, you have to write the custom code to send the email but this will work. 

Hence, to solve this we have released a new plugin called "WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery'. You can download it from here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-cart-abandonment-recovery/

This will automatically capture the user's email id from the checkout page and it will show you that user's info into your wp-admin backend. 

Also, this plugin will help you to schedule the cart abandonment emails and this will be automatically sent to the abandoned user after the certain time which you have set in the email template. Also in the abandoned email, the user will get the checkout page link where his products will be automatically added in the cart/checkout page to make him easier to make a purchase. 

I hope this will help you. 

Feel free to get in touch in case you need more help.

403 Error

Apologize for the incovenience.

Here is a screenshot of your issue - https://imgur.com/81zXYqq

The problem is, that request is Receiving a 403 response for CartFlows pages and not for WooCommerce pages. This is the reason WooCommerce is working and CartFlows not.

Receiving a 403 response is the server telling you, "I'm sorry. I know who you are–I believe who you say you are–but you just don't have permission to access this resource. Maybe if you ask the system administrator nicely, you'll get permission. But please don't bother me again until your predicament changes."

In summary, a 403 Forbidden response should be used afterward, when the user is authenticated but isn't authorized to perform the requested operation on the given resource.

Probably due to the following reasons,
1. If you are using a firewall plugin.
2. The host is not allowing that request for other pages than WooCommerce.
3. Cache plugins or server-side cache.

Can you please confirm with a host? Show them the above screenshot. They will help you exclude the CartFlows pages.

I hope this helps you. Let me know once your host provider replies to you.

Thanks for your patience.


========================================================================================================================================================

Why Not to cache the Checkout page?

We recommand not to cache the CartFlows Checkout page because, that page contains the current user's information and many dynamic scripts which are used to get the information as per the user.

So, if these scripts are get cached then there is a chance of the issue be arise such as this infinite loader. 

To help you with this better, can you please clear the local & Server cache on your website as well as add the CartFlows Checkout pages in not to cache setting on your server or local side. 

We do have an article on this, which might help you to get the idea: https://cartflows.com/docs/disable-caching/

Your Cart is empty error

﻿Hello,
﻿
Welcome to the CartFlows Support!
﻿Let me tell you that these messages will be displayed if the following is wrong or misconfigured.
﻿
﻿1. If the CartFlows Checkout page's shortcode is placed on the Default WooCommerce's checkout page. 
﻿2. If the CartFlows Checkout page is not set as a Global checkout page & viewed directly without selecting any product in the backend setting of the checkout page.
﻿3. If the site does not contain the Default Checkout page.
﻿
﻿Can you please let me know does your site has all of this setting correctly configured? 
﻿
Looking forward to hearing from you.
